## Get the book & watch the talk

LemontMart has been developed in support of my book _Angular for Enterprise-Ready Web Applications_. You can get the book at any major bookstore or find the links at http://AngularForEnterprise.com.

Watch the talk on `Architecture for Scalable Angular Apps` on [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-denver-2019-session-28).

Check out the slides for `Architecture for Scalable Angular Apps` _free_ at [Slides.com](https://slides.com/doguhanuluca/architecture-for-scalable-angular-apps#).

Check out **LocalCast Weather**, to learn Angular, Material, RxJS fundemantals using OpenWeatherMap.org APIs, at https://github.com/duluca/local-weather-app.

Build, debug and publish Docker images with [**npm Scripts for Docker**](https://bit.ly/npmScriptsForDocker) and achieve Blue-Green deployments on AWS Fargate with [**npm Scripts for AWS**](https://bit.ly/npmScriptsForAWS).

## Router-first Approach

A router-first approach to SPA design will save development teams, large and small, significant waste in duplicative work, and re-architecting of the code base to enable better collaboration or achieve sub-second first meaningful paints in your application.

In order to pull off a router-first implementation, you need to:

1. Define user roles and a site-map early on,
2. Design with lazy loading in mind, leveraging router outlets, auxiliary paths and smart link tracking,
3. Implement a walking-skeleton navigation experience and validate, allowing multiple teams to execute seamlessly,
4. Design around major data components, using stateless data-driven components using RxJS/BehaviorSubjects,
5. Be disciplined in sticking to a decoupled component architecture, allowing remixing the UX quickly to respond to changes in requirements without having to re-architect the codebase,
6. Differentiate between user controls and components to appropriate use binding, resolve and auth guards,
7. With TypeScript classes, interfaces, enums, validators and pipes maximize code reuse

### Design Artifacts

Head over to the Wiki for user roles, site maps, data entity diagrams and user mock ups:
https://github.com/duluca/lemon-mart/wiki.

## Building Lemon Mart

- `npm run build:prod` to build a production optimized version of the app.
- `npm run docker:debug` to run tests and build a containerized version of the app.
- `integration.Dockerfile` is a multi-stage Dockerfile that can be used to build and test the app in various CI environments in a consistent mannger. The optimized image generated in the last step, can then be deployed to any Docker host, including AWS, Heroku, Zeit Now and Azure.

### Authentication

For demonstration purposes the login screen shows the _Authentication Mode_ of the app. There are three modes:

- InMemory: [auth.inmemory.service.ts](https://github.com/duluca/lemon-mart/blob/master/src/app/auth/auth.inmemory.service.ts)
- Custom: [auth.custom.service.ts](https://github.com/duluca/lemon-mart/blob/master/src/app/auth/auth.custom.service.ts)
- Firebase: [auth.firebase.service.ts](https://github.com/duluca/lemon-mart/blob/master/src/app/auth/auth.firebase.service.ts)

The current mode can be adjusted in `environment.ts`. You can see how each mode is implemented in the link source files above.

> This is covered in more detail in [Angular for Enterprise, 2nd Edition](https://expertlysimple.io/angular-for-enterprise-2nd-edition/).

### Build Configurations

There are 3 build configurations that maps to authentication modes:

1. Production:

Executing `npm run build:prod` or `npx ng build --prod` or `npx ng build --configuration=production` leverages `InMemory` authentication. Note that the fake credentials are documented on the Login screen.

2. Firebase:

Executing `npx ng build --configuration=firebase` leverages `Firebase` authentication. For this to work, you must setup your own Firebase back-end and create a user in the Firebase console.

3. Lemon-Mart-Server:

Executing `npx ng build --configuration=lemon-mart-server` leverages `Custom` authentication. Note that this is implemented by the example projects Lemon Mart Server, which is detailed below.

### Lemon Mart Server

Lemon Mart Server is an easy to learn and use TypeScript Node.js server using [Minimal MEAN](https://github.com/duluca/minimal-mean) for [Lemon Mart](https://github.com/duluca/lemon-mart).

## Developers

This project is a sample implementation, which contains numerous recipes and design patterns useful to develop an Angular application.

If you'd like to use this project as a starter or a template project for your project, you can get a lot of benefit out of using a pre-configured project. Some the benefits are:

- Optimized development experience for VS Code
- Lazy loading feature module configuration
- A responsive landing, login, and user profile experience
- Angular Material and Angular Flex Layout configured for UI development
- npm scripts for `style` and `lint` checks, building docker containers, testing, or deploying your app
- CircleCI configuration for Continuous Integration
- Pre-wired extensible authentication and authorization module
- And many more.

### Pre-requisites

- Do NOT install `@angular/cli` or `typescript` globally to avoid version mismatch issues across multiple projects.
  - Note: When creating new projects in the future, execute `npx @angular/cli new app-name --routing` to create a new Angular app with basic routing wired.
  - If you have trouble with this command, try `npx -p @angular/cli new app-name --routing`
- To run `ng` commands from within the project directory, preprend `npx` to commands, like `npx ng build`.
- To continue using `ng` without having to prepend `npx`, configure shell autofallback as described here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx#shell-auto-fallback.

### Adapting the template

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Rename the repo on GitHub to match the name of your project.
- Search and replace references to `lemon-mart` with your project name and git repo.
- Remove `manager`, `pos`, and `inventory` folders and references to them from `app-routing.module.ts`.
- You may modify `profile.component.ts` and `view-user.component.ts` under the `user` folder to fit your needs.
- Edit `lemonmart-theme.scss` to match your desired color scheme.
- Now you may begin implementing your own feature modules.
  - Questions? Consider creating an issue on this repo and buying my book at http://AngularForEnterprise.com.

### During Development

- Run `npm start` for a developmenet web server.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
  - Note that the port is different than the default Angular port of `4200` intentionally, so you can run test projects or proof of concepts side-by-side without the hassle of specifiying a new port.
- Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Code scaffolding

- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
